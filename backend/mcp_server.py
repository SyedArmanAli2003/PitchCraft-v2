"""PitchCraft MongoDB MCP server — a real, protocol-compliant MCP server.

This exposes the PitchCraft MongoDB data layer as Model Context Protocol tools.
It's a genuine MCP server (built on the official `mcp` SDK), not a façade — it
can be consumed two ways:

  1. As a standard **stdio MCP server** by any MCP client (Claude Desktop,
     Cursor, the MCP Inspector, …):

         cd backend && python mcp_server.py
         # or:  mcp run mcp_server.py

     Example Claude Desktop config:
         {
           "mcpServers": {
             "pitchcraft-mongodb": {
               "command": "python",
               "args": ["/abs/path/to/backend/mcp_server.py"]
             }
           }
         }

  2. **In-process by the PitchCraft agent** over the real MCP protocol via an
     in-memory client↔server session (see `agent.call_mcp_tool`). The agent's
     market-research (Step 2) and financial (Step 5) grounding flows through
     these MCP tool calls — MongoDB is literally giving the agent its
     "superpowers" through MCP.

The tools are thin, well-described wrappers over `insforge.py`.
